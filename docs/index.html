				health risks, which can diminish their trip enjoyment. They may also encounter challenges like 
				crime, unsafe water, poor sanitation, along with language barriers and cultural differences 
				that make finding help difficult. As a result, many stick to crowded, well-known spots or fall 
				into tourist traps due to uncertainty about where to explore.</p>
